<p>ulimit: ulimit [-SHabcdefiklmnpqrstuvxPT] [limit]
</p><p>    Modify shell resource limits.
    
</p><p>    Provides control over the resources available to the shell and processes
    it creates, on systems that allow such control.
    
</p><dl>
  <dt>Options</dt>
<dd>      -S        use the `soft' resource limit
      -H        use the `hard' resource limit
      -a        all current limits are reported
      -b        the socket buffer size
      -c        the maximum size of core files created
      -d        the maximum size of a process's data segment
      -e        the maximum scheduling priority (`nice')
      -f        the maximum size of files written by the shell and its children
      -i        the maximum number of pending signals
      -k        the maximum number of kqueues allocated for this process
      -l        the maximum size a process may lock into memory
      -m        the maximum resident set size
      -n        the maximum number of open file descriptors
      -p        the pipe buffer size
      -q        the maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues
      -r        the maximum real-time scheduling priority
      -s        the maximum stack size
      -t        the maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
      -u        the maximum number of user processes
      -v        the size of virtual memory
      -x        the maximum number of file locks
      -P        the maximum number of pseudoterminals
      -T        the maximum number of threads
    
</dd></dl>
<p>    Not all options are available on all platforms.
    
</p><p>    If LIMIT is given, it is the new value of the specified resource; the
    special LIMIT values `soft', `hard', and `unlimited' stand for the
    current soft limit, the current hard limit, and no limit, respectively.
    Otherwise, the current value of the specified resource is printed.  If
    no option is given, then -f is assumed.
    
</p><p>    Values are in 1024-byte increments, except for -t, which is in seconds,
    -p, which is in increments of 512 bytes, and -u, which is an unscaled
    number of processes.
    
</p><p>    Exit Status:<br/>
    Returns success unless an invalid option is supplied or an error occurs.</p>
