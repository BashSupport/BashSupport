<p> ldd [OPTION]... FILE...
</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>

       ldd  prints  the  shared  libraries  required by each program or shared
       library specified on the command line.

</pre>
<p><strong>BUGS</strong>
</p>

<p> ldd does not work on a.out shared libraries.
</p>
<pre>
       ldd does not work with some extremely old  a.out  programs  which  were
       built  before  ldd  support was added to the compiler releases.  If you
       use ldd on one of these programs, the program will attempt to run  with
       argc = 0 and the results will be unpredictable.
