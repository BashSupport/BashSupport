<p><strong>GZIP(1) GZIP(1)</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>NAME</strong>
</p>

<p> gzip, gunzip, zcat - compress or expand files
</p>

<p><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong>
</p><pre>
       gzip [ -acdfhlLnNrtvV19 ] [-S suffix] [ name ...  ]
       gunzip [ -acfhlLnNrtvV ] [-S suffix] [ name ...  ]
       zcat [ -fhLV ] [ name ...  ]
</pre>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>
</p><pre>
       Gzip  reduces  the  size  of  the  named  files using Lempel-Ziv coding
       (LZ77).  Whenever possible, each file  is  replaced  by  one  with  the
       extension .gz, while keeping the same ownership modes, access and modi‐
       fication times.  (The default extension is -gz for VMS,  z  for  MSDOS,
       OS/2  FAT, Windows NT FAT and Atari.)  If no files are specified, or if
       a file name is "-", the standard input is compressed  to  the  standard
       output.  Gzip will only attempt to compress regular files.  In particu‐
       lar, it will ignore symbolic links.

       If the compressed file name is too long for its file system, gzip trun‐
       cates  it.   Gzip  attempts to truncate only the parts of the file name
       longer than 3 characters.  (A part is delimited by dots.) If  the  name
       consists  of  small  parts  only,  the longest parts are truncated. For
       example, if file names are limited to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe  is
       compressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz.  Names are not truncated on systems which
       do not have a limit on file name length.

       By default, gzip keeps the original file name and timestamp in the com‐
       pressed  file.  These  are used when decompressing the file with the -N
       option. This is useful when the compressed file name was  truncated  or
       when the time stamp was not preserved after a file transfer.

       Compressed  files  can be restored to their original form using gzip -d
       or gunzip or zcat.  If the original name saved in the  compressed  file
       is not suitable for its file system, a new name is constructed from the
       original one to make it legal.

       gunzip takes a list of files on its command line and replaces each file
       whose  name  ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, _z or .Z and which begins with
       the correct magic number with an uncompressed file without the original
       extension.  gunzip also recognizes the special extensions .tgz and .taz
       as shorthands for .tar.gz and .tar.Z respectively.   When  compressing,
       gzip  uses the .tgz extension if necessary instead of truncating a file
       with a .tar extension.

       gunzip can currently decompress files created by gzip,  zip,  compress,
       compress  -H  or pack.  The detection of the input format is automatic.
       When using the first two formats, gunzip checks a 32 bit CRC. For pack,
       gunzip checks the uncompressed length. The standard compress format was
       not designed to allow consistency checks. However gunzip  is  sometimes
       able  to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an error when uncompressing a
       .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file is correct simply  because  the
       standard  uncompress  does  not complain. This generally means that the
       standard uncompress does not check its  input,  and  happily  generates
       garbage  output.   The  SCO compress -H format (lzh compression method)
       does not include a CRC but also allows some consistency checks.

       Files created by zip can be uncompressed by gzip only if  they  have  a
       single  member  compressed with the 'deflation' method. This feature is
       only intended to help conversion of tar.zip files to the tar.gz format.
       To  extract  a zip file with a single member, use a command like gunzip
       &lt;foo.zip or gunzip -S .zip foo.zip.  To extract zip files with  several
       members, use unzip instead of gunzip.

       zcat  is  identical  to  gunzip  -c.   (On  some  systems,  zcat may be
       installed as gzcat to preserve the original link  to  compress.)   zcat
       uncompresses either a list of files on the command line or its standard
       input and writes the uncompressed data on standard output.   zcat  will
       uncompress files that have the correct magic number whether they have a
       .gz suffix or not.

       Gzip uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in zip and PKZIP.   The  amount
       of  compression  obtained depends on the size of the input and the dis‐
       tribution of common substrings.  Typically, text such as source code or
       English  is  reduced  by  60-70%.  Compression is generally much better
       than that achieved by LZW (as used in  compress),  Huffman  coding  (as
       used in pack), or adaptive Huffman coding (compact).

       Compression  is  always  performed,  even  if  the  compressed  file is
       slightly larger than the original. The worst case expansion  is  a  few
       bytes  for  the  gzip  file header, plus 5 bytes every 32K block, or an
       expansion ratio of 0.015% for large files. Note that the actual  number
       of  used  disk blocks almost never increases.  gzip preserves the mode,
       ownership and timestamps of files when compressing or decompressing.

       The gzip file format is specified in P. Deutsch, GZIP file format spec‐
       ification version 4.3, &lt;<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1952.txt">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1952.txt</a>&gt;, Inter‐
       net <a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/rfc/rfc1952.txt">RFC 1952</a> (May 1996).  The zip deflation format is specified  in  P.
       Deutsch,  DEFLATE  Compressed  Data  Format  Specification version 1.3,
       &lt;<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1951.txt">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1951.txt</a>&gt;, Internet <a
        href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/rfc/rfc1951.txt">RFC 1951</a> (May 1996).
</pre>
<p><strong>OPTIONS</strong>
</p><pre>
       -a --ascii
              Ascii text mode: convert end-of-lines using  local  conventions.
              This  option  is  supported  only  on some non-Unix systems. For
              MSDOS, CR LF is converted to LF when compressing, and LF is con‐
              verted to CR LF when decompressing.

       -c --stdout --to-stdout
              Write  output on standard output; keep original files unchanged.
              If there are several input  files,  the  output  consists  of  a
              sequence  of  independently compressed members. To obtain better
              compression, concatenate  all  input  files  before  compressing
              them.

       -d --decompress --uncompress
              Decompress.

       -f --force
              Force compression or decompression even if the file has multiple
              links or the corresponding file already exists, or if  the  com‐
              pressed data is read from or written to a terminal. If the input
              data is not in a format recognized by gzip, and  if  the  option
              --stdout  is  also  given, copy the input data without change to
              the standard output: let zcat behave  as  cat.   If  -f  is  not
              given,  and  when not running in the background, gzip prompts to
              verify whether an existing file should be overwritten.

       -h --help
              Display a help screen and quit.

       -l --list
              For each compressed file, list the following fields:

                  compressed size: size of the compressed file
                  uncompressed size: size of the uncompressed file
                  ratio: compression ratio (0.0% if unknown)
                  uncompressed_name: name of the uncompressed file

              The uncompressed size is given as -1 for files not in gzip  for‐
              mat,  such  as compressed .Z files. To get the uncompressed size
              for such a file, you can use:

                  zcat file.Z | wc -c

              In combination with the --verbose option, the  following  fields
              are also displayed:

                  method: compression method
                  crc: the 32-bit CRC of the uncompressed data
                  date &amp; time: time stamp for the uncompressed file

              The  compression  methods  currently supported are deflate, com‐
              press, lzh (SCO compress -H) and pack.   The  crc  is  given  as
              ffffffff for a file not in gzip format.

              With  --name,  the  uncompressed name,  date and time  are those
              stored within the compress file if present.

              With --verbose, the size totals and compression  ratio  for  all
              files  is  also  displayed,  unless some sizes are unknown. With
              --quiet, the title and totals lines are not displayed.

       -L --license
              Display the gzip license and quit.

       -n --no-name
              When compressing, do not save the original file  name  and  time
              stamp by default. (The original name is always saved if the name
              had to be truncated.) When decompressing,  do  not  restore  the
              original  file name if present (remove only the gzip suffix from
              the compressed file name) and do not restore the  original  time
              stamp if present (copy it from the compressed file). This option
              is the default when decompressing.

       -N --name
              When compressing, always save the original file  name  and  time
              stamp;  this  is  the  default.  When decompressing, restore the
              original file name and time stamp if  present.  This  option  is
              useful on systems which have a limit on file name length or when
              the time stamp has been lost after a file transfer.

       -q --quiet
              Suppress all warnings.

       -r --recursive
              Travel the directory structure recursively. If any of  the  file
              names  specified  on the command line are directories, gzip will
              descend into the directory and compress all the files  it  finds
              there (or decompress them in the case of gunzip ).

       --rsyncable
              While  compressing, synchronize the output occasionally based on
              the input.  This increases size by  less  than  1  percent  most
              cases,  but  means that the rsync(1) program can much more effi‐
              ciently synchronize files compressed  with  this  flag.   gunzip
              cannot  tell  the  difference  between a compressed file created
              with this option, and one created without it.

       -S .suf --suffix .suf
              Use suffix .suf instead of .gz. Any suffix  can  be  given,  but
              suffixes other than .z and .gz should be avoided to avoid confu‐
              sion when files are transferred to other systems.  A null suffix
              forces  gunzip  to  try decompression on all given files regard‐
              less of suffix, as in:

                  gunzip -S "" <em> (</em>.* for MSDOS)

              Previous versions of gzip used the .z suffix. This  was  changed
              to avoid a conflict with pack(1).

       -t --test
              Test. Check the compressed file integrity.

       -v --verbose
              Verbose. Display the name and percentage reduction for each file
              compressed or decompressed.

       -V --version
              Version. Display the version number and compilation options then
              quit.

       -# --fast --best
              Regulate  the  speed of compression using the specified digit #,
              where -1 or --fast  indicates  the  fastest  compression  method
              (less  compression)  and -9 or --best indicates the slowest com‐
              pression method (best  compression).   The  default  compression
              level is -6 (that is, biased towards high compression at expense
              of speed).
</pre>
<p><strong>ADVANCED USAGE</strong>
</p><pre>
       Multiple compressed files can be concatenated.  In  this  case,  gunzip
       will extract all members at once. For example:

             gzip -c file1  &gt; foo.gz
             gzip -c file2 &gt;&gt; foo.gz

       Then

             gunzip -c foo

       is equivalent to

             cat file1 file2

       In  case of damage to one member of a .gz file, other members can still
       be recovered (if the damaged member is removed). However, you  can  get
       better compression by compressing all members at once:

             cat file1 file2 | gzip &gt; foo.gz

       compresses better than

             gzip -c file1 file2 &gt; foo.gz

       If you want to recompress concatenated files to get better compression,
       do:

             gzip -cd old.gz | gzip &gt; new.gz

       If a compressed file consists of several members, the uncompressed size
       and  CRC reported by the --list option applies to the last member only.
       If you need the uncompressed size for all members, you can use:

             gzip -cd file.gz | wc -c

       If you wish to create a single archive file with  multiple  members  so
       that members can later be extracted independently, use an archiver such
       as tar or zip. GNU tar supports the -z option to invoke gzip  transpar‐
       ently. gzip is designed as a complement to tar, not as a replacement.
</pre>
<p><strong>ENVIRONMENT</strong>
</p><pre>
       The  environment  variable  GZIP  can hold a set of default options for
       gzip.  These options are interpreted first and can  be  overwritten  by
       explicit command line parameters. For example:
             for sh:    GZIP="-8v --name"; export GZIP
             for csh:   setenv GZIP "-8v --name"
             for MSDOS: set GZIP=-8v --name

       On  Vax/VMS, the name of the environment variable is GZIP_OPT, to avoid
       a conflict with the symbol set for invocation of the program.

<p><strong>DIAGNOSTICS</strong>
</p><pre>
       Exit  status  is normally 0; if an error occurs, exit status is 1. If a
       warning occurs, exit status is 2.

       Usage: gzip [-cdfhlLnNrtvV19] [-S suffix] [file ...]
              Invalid options were specified on the command line.

       file: not in gzip format
              The file specified to gunzip has not been compressed.

       file: Corrupt input. Use zcat to recover some data.
              The compressed file has been damaged. The data up to  the  point
              of failure can be recovered using

                    zcat file &gt; recover

       file: compressed with xx bits, can only handle yy bits
              File  was  compressed  (using  LZW) by a program that could deal
              with more bits than the decompress code on this machine.  Recom‐
              press  the file with gzip, which compresses better and uses less
              memory.

       file: already has .gz suffix -- no change
              The file is assumed to be already compressed.  Rename  the  file
              and try again.

       file already exists; do you wish to overwrite (y or n)?
              Respond  "y"  if you want the output file to be replaced; "n" if
              not.

       gunzip: corrupt input
              A SIGSEGV violation was detected which usually  means  that  the
              input file has been corrupted.

       xx.x% Percentage of the input saved by compression.
              (Relevant only for -v and -l.)

       -- not a regular file or directory: ignored
              When  the input file is not a regular file or directory, (e.g. a
              symbolic link, socket, FIFO, device file), it is left unaltered.

       -- has xx other links: unchanged
              The input file has links; it is left unchanged.  See  ln(1)  for
              more information. Use the -f flag to force compression of multi‐
              ply-linked files.
</pre>
<p><strong>CAVEATS</strong>
</p><pre>
       When writing compressed data to a tape, it is  generally  necessary  to
       pad  the  output  with  zeroes up to a block boundary. When the data is
       read and the whole block is passed to gunzip for decompression,  gunzip
       detects  that there is extra trailing garbage after the compressed data
       and emits a warning by default. You have to use the --quiet  option  to
       suppress  the  warning.  This option can be set in the GZIP environment
       variable as in:
         for sh:  GZIP="-q"  tar -xfz --block-compress /dev/rst0
         for csh: (setenv GZIP -q; tar -xfz --block-compr /dev/rst0

       In the above example, gzip is invoked implicitly by the  -z  option  of
       GNU  tar. Make sure that the same block size (-b option of tar) is used
       for reading and  writing  compressed  data  on  tapes.   (This  example
       assumes you are using the GNU version of tar.)
</pre>
<p><strong>BUGS</strong>
</p><pre>
       The  gzip  format  represents the input size modulo 2^32, so the --list
       option reports incorrect uncompressed sizes and compression ratios  for
       uncompressed  files  4 GB and larger.  To work around this problem, you
       can use the following command to discover a large  uncompressed  file's
       true size:

             zcat file.gz | wc -c

       The  --list  option reports sizes as -1 and crc as ffffffff if the com‐
       pressed file is on a non seekable media.

       In some rare cases, the --best option gives worse compression than  the
       default  compression  level  (-6). On some highly redundant files, com‐
       press compresses better than gzip.
