<p>KILL(1) Linux User's Manual KILL(1)
</p>

<p><strong>NAME</strong>
</p>

<p> kill - send a signal to a process
</p>

<p><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong>
</p><pre>
       kill [ -signal | -s signal ] pid ...
       kill [ -L | -V, --version ]
       kill -l  [ signal ]
</pre>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>
</p><pre>
       The  default  signal  for  kill is TERM. Use -l or -L to list available
       signals.  Particularly useful signals include  HUP,  INT,  KILL,  STOP,
       CONT,  and  0.   Alternate  signals  may be specified in three ways: -9
       -SIGKILL -KILL.  Negative PID  values  may  be  used  to  choose  whole
       process  groups;  see the PGID column in ps command output. A PID of -1
       is special; it indicates all processes except the kill  process  itself
       and init.
</pre>
<p><strong>SIGNALS</strong>

<p><strong>NOTES</strong>
</p><pre>
       Your shell (command line interpreter) may have a built-in kill command.
       You  may  need  to run the command described here as /bin/kill to solve
       the conflict.
</pre>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong>
</p><pre>
       kill -9 -1
              Kill all processes you can kill.

       kill -l 11
              Translate number 11 into a signal name.

       kill -L
              List the available signal choices in a nice table.

       kill 123 543 2341 3453
              Send the default signal, SIGTERM, to all those processes.

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>
</p><pre>
       Albert  Cahalan  &lt;<a href="mailto:albert@users.sf.net">albert@users.sf.net</a>&gt;  wrote kill in 1999 to replace a
       bsdutils one that was not standards compliant. The util-linux one might
       also work correctly.
