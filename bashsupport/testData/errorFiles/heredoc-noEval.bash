#   No parameter substitution when the "limit string" is quoted or escaped.
#   Either of the following at the head of the here document would have

#   cat <<"Endofmessage"
#   cat <<\Endofmessage



#   And, likewise:

cat <<"SpecialCharTest"

if limit string were not quoted.
`ls -l`

Arithmetic expansion would take place
if limit string were not quoted.
$((5 + 3))

if limit string were not quoted.
